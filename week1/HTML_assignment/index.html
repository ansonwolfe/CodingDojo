			<h2>Adventures Around the Bay</h2>

			Life is pretty boring if it's all sleep and no play.  So whenever I get the chance, I ask to go for a trip.  It doesn't matter if it's the dog park or a great hike in the hills.  I like fresh air.  Sometimes I get jipped and only get a brisk walk around the block.  I protest on those.  You would too wouldn't you?  I ordered steak and only got ground beef.  See what I mean? 

			<h3>Answers to what you may be thinking</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I am smaller than what you think and bigger than your first guess.</li>
				<li>I am older than I look and younger than the sun.</li>
				<li>I am only as friendly as you will let me pet you.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Some others things to note...</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>I am not a cat!  </li>
				<li>My name is NOT "Coco"! </li>
				<li>I like fruits and vegetables except for grapes and nuts which would kill me.</li>
			</ol>
